## Installing

### Mac OS X

Download the latest [Particle Dev release](https://github.com/spark/spark-dev/releases/latest).

Particle Dev will automatically update when a new release is available.

### Windows

Download the latest [Particle Dev release](https://github.com/spark/spark-dev/releases/latest).

Particle Dev for Windows does not currently automatically update when a new release is available; you will have to download a new version manually when updates are released. We hope to see this change in the future.
